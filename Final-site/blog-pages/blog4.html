            <h1>Changes</h1>
            <p>Adam Downing - 12/02/20</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">

            <p>The first edition of my website can be found <a href="http://www.17068764.webdevmmu.uk/index.html">here.</a></p>

             <p>Based on the feedback that I received from my tutors and classmates I have gone ahead in making a small number of changes to my portfolio site. From the feedback the design of my website was good, there was some small issues that needed ironing out. Firstly, in relation to the homepage I have ensured that the headers are closer to the paragraph to improve the flow of the website. Furthermore, I have ensured that there is now enough space within the message section of the contact form, so the user is able to see what they are typing. It was also evident that the hero image was covering the hero text, so padding has been added to ensure it is no longer covered.</p>

            <p>Within the blog pages I have removed the number of the blog so the user is able to focus on the title as this may have been distracting the user. Additionally, throughout the whole website I have decided to swap the fonts for headings and paragraphs as it enables the user to read paragraphs much more clearly and overall improve the design of the website. On the blog posts there was previously a large amount of whitespace next to the images, which made the webpage look distorted and ruined the overall flow for the reader. To combat this, text has been floated around the images. </p>

            <p>Another aspect that couldâ€™ve been improved was that the user had no direction of where to go when they reached the bottom of the blog posts, so buttons have been added that allow the user to navigate between each blog post. There were also a few issues with grammar throughout the site which have been eradicated. It was also difficult for the user to be able to tell when they were hovering over a link, to ensure they knew which link they were selecting, an underline has been added following the same design scheme.</p>

            <p>Alignment appeared to be an issue throughout the website, especially throughout the CV page and has now been corrected to help improve design as it appeared misleading before and was difficult to read. Likewise, image alignment on the blog pages has been corrected to ensure it is flush with text. </p>

            <p>Within the coding of my website there was a few issues such as poor metadata, the same description had been used throughout each page which is poor practice so I have altered this for each page alongside the titles of each page, to give a better overview of what the user is to expect. File architecture was also another problem, the blog HTML pages have been moved to a specific folder to allow for better structure and organisation. Furthermore, the use of multiple CSS files results in wasting bandwidth needlessly and is bad practice so all of the files have been compacted into one singular file. </p>
